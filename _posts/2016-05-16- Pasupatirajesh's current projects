Today's topic of writing would be about the current projects that I am working on. Along with configuring this website, I am also working
on learning making apps for the Android Platform from The Bignerdranch programming guide for developing Android Applications. I have completed working on 
5 different apps that actually teaches you right from setting up the development environment to developing a complex application that involves various features of the Android OS.
Apps developed so far dvelved into using Activities, Fragments, Intents, SQLite Databases, WebView, Broadcast Intents and Services.

These are some of the core concepts that one would have to learn to be able to write an Android application. I will be revisiting these apps in future blog posts and talk in detail as to the topics covered in writing the app.
I will also post screen shots of an working application on this website as well as provide links to my repositories for the Android application.

Wish me luck fellas, One step at a time :-)
