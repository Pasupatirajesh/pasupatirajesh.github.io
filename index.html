      <h1> Hi there, Pasupatirajesh here. Learning to write some good Code </h1>
        <p> I have dabbled in a lot of fields before writing my first line of code two years ago. The reason being fear of failure and lack of self belief.
        But then two years ago, I decided to start learning to write code. I am currently working on a couple of interesting projects. I would prefer to keep learning
        and improve upon my knowledge base and work my way up as a software developer. Fingers Crossed.<a href="/about"> Read more about me as I regularly update this webpage.</a> </p>
